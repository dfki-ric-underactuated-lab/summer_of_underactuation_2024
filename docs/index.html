<h1 id="event-summary">Event Summary</h1>
<p>The <a
href="https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/research-facilities-labs/underactuated-lab/">Underactuated
Lab</a> at <a
href="https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/startpage.html">DFKI Robotics
Innovation Center</a> is committed to pushing the limits of our robots
to achieve animal-like physical/athletic intelligence. Our lab generally
hosts a group of exchange students every summer with diverse backgrounds
from all over Europe with a shared vision of developing athletic
intelligence for underactuated robotic systems (for example, the last
year’s proceedings/videos can be found <a
href="https://dfki-ric-underactuated-lab.github.io/summer_of_underactuation_2022/">here</a>).
The Summer of Underactuation 2023 event continues this tradition from
last year and intends to highlight the scientific work of the exchange
students working with the underactuated lab to everyone working at
DFKI-RIC. We would like to invite you to join us over lunchtime on
<strong>29 September 2023 (Friday) from 12:00 to 16:00 in the B0.10
seminar room</strong> to enjoy monkey-like brachiation movements,
parkour with monopods, the latest insights into reinforcement learning
for achieving dynamic movements, controllers for floating robots in
space and in water, and understanding hybrid rovers.</p>

Learning Based Underactuated control of double pendulum by Chi
Zhang</h2>
<p>Reinforcement learning-based control for robots has been a popular
research topic in recent years. It has demonstrated potential advantages
over traditional control methods for nonlinear systems, including
reduced reliance on model information and improved adaptability to model
uncertainty and changes in control objectives. The double pendulum
system is a widely studied control scenario. With its highly nonlinear
dynamical model and chaotic behavior, it proves to be a challenge for
underactuated control using conventional methods. Through the
introduction of reinforcement learning techniques, a broader range of
control possibilities will be explored.</p>

Inverse Kinematics of a 6R-U-S Parallel Kinematic Mechanism by
Vinayvivian Rodrigues</h2>
<p>Parallel manipulators are widely employed in industrial automation,
capitalizing on their kinematic precision and structural rigidity
compared to serial counterparts. Interaction between humans and
manipulators boosts productivity and product quality, highlighting
safety as a paramount concern. Analytical Inverse kinematic formulation
for a 6-RUS rigid parallel kinematic formulation is developed to show
trajectory following capability in 3D space using position control
framework. To validate the analytical formulation, a simulation of the
same is developed in Pybullet physics-based simulator. Furthermore, a
simulation model of a flexible 6-legged parallel manipulator is also
proposed to show the continuum behavior of the parallel structure.</p>

Optimization and Stabilization for Underactuated AUVs by Lukas Rust</h2>
<p>In underwater robotics drag and resistive forces are crucial to the
performance of AUVs. Addressing these forces in control can decrease
energy consumption and increase maneuverability. A Trajectory
Optimization and Stabilization architecture is proposed for the
underactuated DeepLeng AUV, developed during the EurEx-LUNa project. By
adding a hydrodynamic model to the optimization problem, the planned
trajectories exploit the hydrodynamic properties of the AUV. A time
varying LQR based on the linearized hydrodynamic model stabilizes the
AUV around the trajectory.</p>

Strategies for a Rimless Wheel Micro-Rover by Dennis Schlee</h2>
<p>Rimless wheeled robots are a hybrid variant of traditionally wheeled
and legged robots. These hybrid systems combine the benefits of both
approaches, such as efficient power demands and good terrain
traversability. However, the simplicity of the design of the rimless
wheel has the disadvantage of limiting the flexibility on foot placement
and the impacts caused on the body when navigating rigid surfaces. To
tackle these disadvantages, a gait control system is proposed that
pursues the minimization of the forces in these impact phases and
therefore reduces vertical motion of the rover center body.</p>

of Dynamic Parkour Motions for a Hopping Leg on a Broomstick Leg by
Maximilian Albracht</h2>
<p>Parkour presents a challenging environment that demands dynamic,
robust, and precise movements from robotic systems. Traversing it with a
one-legged hopper introduces additional challenges, such as planning
over contacts, which necessitates a sophisticated controller. To tackle
this, a control system is proposed, utilizing mixed integer programming
for motion planning to determine a feasible and optimal path over an
extended horizon. The execution of this path is achieved through a state
machine employing a PD control scheme with feedforward torques, ensuring
robust and accurate performance.</p>

Shourie Grama Srinivas</h2>
<p>Brachiation, employed by monkeys like Gibbons, involves swinging
between branches. ‘Fast Brachiation’ occurs during dynamic free flight
phases. Studies focus on brachiation robots for tasks like agriculture,
animal mimicry, and forest searches. RicMonk is a 3-link robot designed
for Fast Brachiation. Its passive tail ensures optimal swing velocity.
Overcoming challenges of underactuation and discontinuous motion,
RicMonk currently achieves brachiation in both forward and backward
directions. Contribution includes optimal design, trajectory generation,
and stabilization for a 3-link underactuated robot.</p>

– a new tool for closed form solution of the equations of motion for
open chain robots by Hannah Isermann</h2>
<p>Imagine you are developing a robot, like a quadruped. To set up its
controller and simulation environment, you eventually need to calculate
its kinematics and dynamics. As these equations quickly become
computationally expensive and have to be solved several times a second,
efficient calculations of kinematics and inverse dynamics are
crucial.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, Skidy was implemented. A tool for
symbolic closed form code generation of the equations of motion and its
derivatives for serial and open chain robots. Skidy is easy to use, and
can generate code in several languages, including Python, C++ and
Julia.</p>

Recursive Lie-Group Formulation for the Second-Order Time Derivatives of
the Inverse Dynamics of Parallel Kinematic Manipulators by Mihir
Paygude</h2>
<p>Series elastic actuators (SEA) were introduced for serial robotic
arms. Model-based trajectory tracking control of SEAs’ which requires
the calculation of second-order time derivatives has not been studied in
literature yet. These derivatives provide crucial insights into the
dynamic behavior and performance of the manipulator. To estimate the
time derivatives, we need a computationally efficient algorithm for
second-order time derivatives of the inverse dynamic solution. The
special topology of PKM is utilized reusing the recursive algorithm for
estimation of the inverse dynamics of serial robots. The algorithm takes
into account the Lie Group formulation and all the relations within the
framework of the manipulator, providing accurate and efficient results
for a 6-DOF Gough Stewart platform.</p>

MPC for Free-floating platform with binary thrusters and reaction wheel
by Franek Stark</h2>
<p>Satellites, spacecraft and other floating devices equipped with
thrusters are subject to thruster timing and activation constraints.
Moreover, they are usually equipped with reaction wheels for more
precise alignment, which must not saturate. Traditional control methods
cannot take these constraints into account, making precise control
difficult. For ESA’s Orbital Robotics and GNC Lab’s 3-DOF free-floating
platform, equipped with binary thrusters and a reaction wheel, a
real-time capable Mixed Integer MPC was developed. It allows optimal
control while respecting all system constraints.</p>
